vim-qf  short for vim-quickfix  is a small collection of settings, commands and mappings put together to make working with the quickfix list/window smoother.

FEATURES

    - no soft-wrapping in the quickfix window,
    - no relative numbers in the quickfix window,
    - quickfix buffers are hidden from |:ls| and buffer navigation,
    - optional Ack.vim-inspired mappings,
    - optional mappings for :cnext, :cprevious, :lnext, :lprevious
      that wrap around the beginning an end of the list,
    - optional mapping for jumping to and from the location/quickfix window,
    - filter/restore the list,
    - perform commands on each line in the list,
    - perform commands on each file in the list,
    - open the location/quickfix window automatically after :make, :grep,
      :lvimgrep and friends if there are valid locations/errors
    - quit Vim if the last window is a location/quickfix window
