vim-qf  short for vim-quickfix  is a small collection of settings, commands and mappings put together to make working with the quickfix list/window smoother.

FEATURES

* no relative numbers,
* quickfix buffers hidden from :ls and buffer navigation,
* Ack.vim-inspired mappings,
* wrapping mappings for :cnext, :cprevious, :lnext, :lprevious,
* jump to and from the location/quickfix window with a single mapping
* filter/restore the list
* perform commands on each line in the list
* perform commands on each file in the list
* open the location/quickfix window automatically after :make, :grep,
  :lvimgrep and friends if there are valid locations/errors
* quit Vim if the last window is a location/quickfix window
